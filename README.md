### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**GetFBPageLikes/getfbpagelikes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Web interface to a simple app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on this project.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with GitHub.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my band.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Nouns that have lost their amateur status.

## Problem:

When I try to browse the 1900+ pages I like or follow on Facebook, the Web interface
breaks for all practical purposes.

## Solution:

The simplest solution might be to (directly access that information)[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/likes/] through the Facebook
API.

Another solution could be to crawl the Web page that displays these.
